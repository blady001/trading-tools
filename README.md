# trading-tools

Java/Spring-boot based application for creating market trading strategies (via the implementation of custom technical analysis rules) which generate signals to either buy or sell given assets.

It's just a personal project, nothing professional.

Current implementation covers just Binance crypto exchange connection and pairs offered by that exchange.
